### Peer Review for Lab 2

The Readme file is very comprenhensive of the contents of the notebook. Explains in a very understandable manner how the algorithm designed works and the results expected.

- The algorithm applies correctly the tests and creates differentiation depending on the characteristics of each problem
- The notebook goes above and beyond what was originally asked, adding more than one crossover and edge recombination helpers
- Creating the Individual namedtuple makes it more readable from the GA standpoint
- The nearest_neighbor algorithm provides a good starting ground for the initial population

Even if the algorithm leverages the characteristics of the problem to better apply the crossover methods, it would be worth it to validate other posible combinations of selectors and combinators for all the problems
